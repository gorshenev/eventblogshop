Currently a work in progress.

A friend runs a small clothing store.  She also vends at special events/festivals, sells clothes that she posts on instagram, and keeps a blog.

This project is to build a framework that will cover all of these needs - a blog, an event calendar, and an online shop - all in one easily maintainable package.
